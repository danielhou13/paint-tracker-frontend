# Paint Tracker Website React Frontend

This is a kanban-style board for displaying the stock and status of current paints in the inventory.
This application was built using React.js along with some other packages such as Bootstrap for styling. The code was deployed in Codesandbox.io [here](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/danielhou13/paint-tracker-frontend/main?layout=%257B%2522sidebarPanel%2522%253A%2522GIT%2522%252C%2522rootPanelGroup%2522%253A%257B%2522direction%2522%253A%2522horizontal%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522UNKNOWN%2522%252C%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL_GROUP%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522ROOT_LAYOUT%2522%252C%2522panels%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL_GROUP%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522UNKNOWN%2522%252C%2522direction%2522%253A%2522vertical%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522clu65r9z50006356gmjccxcx8%2522%252C%2522sizes%2522%253A%255B70%252C30%255D%252C%2522panels%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL_GROUP%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522EDITOR%2522%252C%2522direction%2522%253A%2522horizontal%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522EDITOR%2522%252C%2522panels%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522EDITOR%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522clu65r9z50002356gvmi6yi5d%2522%257D%255D%257D%252C%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL_GROUP%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522SHELLS%2522%252C%2522direction%2522%253A%2522horizontal%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522SHELLS%2522%252C%2522panels%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522SHELLS%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522clu65r9z50004356gm2ogc621%2522%257D%255D%252C%2522sizes%2522%253A%255B100%255D%257D%255D%257D%252C%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL_GROUP%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522DEVTOOLS%2522%252C%2522direction%2522%253A%2522vertical%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522DEVTOOLS%2522%252C%2522panels%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522DEVTOOLS%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522clu65r9z50005356gyl0mqzmb%2522%257D%255D%252C%2522sizes%2522%253A%255B100%255D%257D%255D%252C%2522sizes%2522%253A%255B50%252C50%255D%257D%252C%2522tabbedPanels%2522%253A%257B%2522clu65r9z50002356gvmi6yi5d%2522%253A%257B%2522tabs%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522id%2522%253A%2522clu65r9z50001356gjmyq665l%2522%252C%2522mode%2522%253A%2522permanent%2522%252C%2522type%2522%253A%2522FILE%2522%252C%2522filepath%2522%253A%2522%252FREADME.md%2522%252C%2522state%2522%253A%2522IDLE%2522%257D%255D%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522clu65r9z50002356gvmi6yi5d%2522%252C%2522activeTabId%2522%253A%2522clu65r9z50001356gjmyq665l%2522%257D%252C%2522clu65r9z50005356gyl0mqzmb%2522%253A%257B%2522id%2522%253A%2522clu65r9z50005356gyl0mqzmb%2522%252C%2522activeTabId%2522%253A%2522clu65ruc500a7356gt4xjklwt%2522%252C%2522tabs%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522TASK_PORT%2522%252C%2522taskId%2522%253A%2522dev%2522%252C%2522port%2522%253A5173%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522clu65ruc500a7356gt4xjklwt%2522%252C%2522mode%2522%253A%2522permanent%2522%252C%2522path%2522%253A%2522%252Flogin%2522%257D%255D%257D%252C%2522clu65r9z50004356gm2ogc621%2522%253A%257B%2522id%2522%253A%2522clu65r9z50004356gm2ogc621%2522%252C%2522activeTabId%2522%253A%2522clu65rqu6008l356g5ct1pmt0%2522%252C%2522tabs%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522id%2522%253A%2522clu65r9z50003356gazczh6e3%2522%252C%2522mode%2522%253A%2522permanent%2522%252C%2522type%2522%253A%2522TERMINAL%2522%252C%2522shellId%2522%253A%2522clu65rbac000xdkgm3u3wdul2%2522%257D%252C%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522TASK_LOG%2522%252C%2522taskId%2522%253A%2522dev%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522clu65rqu6008l356g5ct1pmt0%2522%252C%2522mode%2522%253A%2522permanent%2522%257D%255D%257D%257D%252C%2522showDevtools%2522%253Atrue%252C%2522showShells%2522%253Atrue%252C%2522showSidebar%2522%253Atrue%252C%2522sidebarPanelSize%2522%253A15%257D).
The frontend interacts with a Django backend found at this [repo](https://github.com/danielhou13/paint_backend). The page will be slightly different based on the user that logged in (more below).

### Login Page
![image](https://github.com/danielhou13/Paint_tracker_website/assets/54420410/ac4bed8f-66a4-4670-9dd4-ce58d8d6f857)

As you can see, it's a very simple login page. Currently, the only users are displayed as a tooltip under each login form field. Obviously, in production, you wouldn't have information such as this, but for demonstration purposes this is sufficient. The passwords for each user are also **identical** (obviously bad in production but sufficient in demonstration) so you only need to update the **username**.
If you try and log in, but enter the wrong credentials, the page will display an error message as follows:

### Main Kanban Board
Remember that there are different use cases for each user, but the general main page looks like this:
![image](https://github.com/danielhou13/Paint_tracker_website/assets/54420410/38bff11f-025c-4a55-98e2-278afed5b955)

Based on the user, we find we see a few things: 
1. For all users, we have a top navbar. In the top navbar, we see the current user, a system admin menu, and a logout button. If you are not **Adam** and click the system admin button, we will get a message saying "only Adam" can access it.
![image](https://github.com/danielhou13/Paint_tracker_website/assets/54420410/a9159bae-94d6-481e-9c1b-d58f435636f7)
1.1. If Adam clicks the System Admin menu button, it will take him to the Django admin page where he can log in and perform system admin duties. More information in the backend repo [here](https://github.com/danielhou13/paint_backend).
2. In the Kanban columns, paints can be dragged between columns, as well as within their own column just to change the display order.
3. The stock can be edited, and because the backend is connected to an Amazon RDS MySQL database, it will persist if you close and reopen the page. Simply click off the paint card and it will update. 
*John cannot update the inventory* as he does not have permission to do so as shown by the lack of "edit stock" buttons.</br>
